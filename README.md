Presentation

## Purpose

This website acts as a demonstration of my skills and knowledge as a web developer, as well as providing information about myself. Through these key points, I am able to both actively and passively promote myself to prospective employers.

## Functionality and Features

This website utilises semantic HTML to cater for accesibility and add meaning. It also features a responsive and minimalistic layout with four screen width breakpoints: 480px, 768px, 1024px, and 1200px.

There are four main pages to navigate:

**Home:** The landing page of the website. Visitors will be immediately drawn to the welcome message that encourages them to learn more about me via the About page. One specific project and blog post of my choosing are featured, as well as the best method of contacting me.

**About:** A simple page that displays personal and professional information about myself. A PDF of my resume is supplied for prospective employers to view.

**Projects:** A showcase of past (placeholder) projects, featuring short (placeholder) descriptions and links to their (placeholder) GitHub repositories.

**Blog:** A list of blog posts. Short snippets of the blog posts are provided at higher resolutions, and visitors can either click on associated title or image to navigate to the corresponding blog post.
